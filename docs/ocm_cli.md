# Deveel OCM CLI (Command-Line Interface)

**Note**: _The application described below is currently under development and not ready to be used_ 

The _Deveel OCM SDK_ provides a console application, written in C# for the .NET / Mono runtime environments, that functions as a client application to the platform, and that enables the administration of the resources owned by tenants.

One of the collateral benefits provided by this application is the ability to automate the creation, management and disposal of resources (like _terminals_, _channels_, _routes_, etc.) within the scope of a given tenant, in _Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery_ scenarios of complex environments.
